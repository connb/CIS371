    <h3>My Life</h3>

    <p>
        I was born in Dallas, TX
        <img src="tx.jpg" alt="Texas" id="tx"/> 
        in 1990 and lived there until I joined the Marines after graduation from high school in 2009. The majority of my time in the Marines was spent in Norfolk, VA
        <img src="va.png" alt="Virginia" id="va"/> 
        where I met my wife in 2013. A year later I finished up my military service, and we moved to Austin, TX in 2014 where I began college at Austin Community College. After 2 years living there, we decided to move to Grand Rapids, MI
        <img src="mi.png" alt="Michigan" id="mi"/> 
        in 2016. We also bought our first home, got married, and I transferred to Grand Valley all in that same year! Many circumstances led to my decision to leave my home state, with the main factor being able to be close to my wife's family who lives here, but I am confident I made the right decision and love living here.

        <h3>My School/Career</h3>
        <p>
            I currently a Senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I will graduate after completion of the Winter 2019 semester. I finished up my internship this Summer as an Integration Analyst with Great Lakes Health Connect (GLHC), and I still currently work there part-time. GLHC is a health information exchange (HIE) which provides the capability to electronically move clinical information among different health care information systems. The goal of HIE is to facilitate access to and retrieval of clinical data to provide safer and more timely, efficient, effective, and equitable patient-centered care. HIE is also useful to public health authorities to assist in analyses of the health of the population. HIE systems facilitate the efforts of physicians and clinicians to meet high standards of patient care through electronic participation in a patient's continuity of care with multiple providers.

                        <img src="feeney.jpg" alt="Chuck Feeney" id="feeney" />
                        <p>Mr. Feeney was born during the great depression to blue collar Irish-American parents. He served in the Air Force during the Korean war, and thereafter went to Cornell School of Hotel Administration on the GI BILL. He began his business selling duty-free booze to sailors, and he eventually amassed a fortune through the company he founded, Duty Free Shoppers. Regardless of his net worth, he has always remained frugal and focused on getting the most out of every dollar spent, or more recently donated. Mr. Feeney was obsessively secret about his net worth, as well as his philanthropy. He wasn't looking for praise, he just did what he felt was right. By 2016 he had donated $7.5 billion (373,000% of his current net worth) to philanthropic causes. I find Mr. Keeney inspirational because he worked hard to make a lot of money, but he never let it get to his head. Coming from a middle-class background he could have went wild with the amount of money he made having never experienced that kind of wealth. Instead, he chose to remain humble and use his fortune for the greater good of mankind.</p>
